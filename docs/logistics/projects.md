# Creating a Long-Term OSPool Project

To continue using your OSPool Account (on `ap40`) after the school, you will 
need to request a long-term project. Please complete the following 
steps by September 15 to transition to a long-term project and access
to the OSPool. 

1. Fill out the following form, setting OSG-School-2023 as the "Project Name". Click 
    on "Submit Manually" when done. 
	
	[Project Creation Form](https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/generate_project_yaml)


1. Copy the text in the grey box. Send that text in an email to support@osg-htc.org, 
**cc'ing the PI of your research group**, asking them to confirm your membership 
in their group. If you are the PI, that should be indicated in 
the email. 

Once the project PI has confirmed your membership, OSG Facilitators will create a new 
project of the form `Institution_PIName`. You will receive
a notification when you are added to the new project, and a follow up email from 
the OSG faciliation team with instructions for how to switch from the 
`OSG_OSGUS23` project 
to your new project.
