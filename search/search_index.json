Learn how this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison During the School, August 7\u201311 , you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems \u2014 at your own campus or using the national-scale Open Science Pool \u2014 to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to get more information and help. The school is ideal for: Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing; Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum. People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG User School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.
