Learn how this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison During the School, August 7\u201311 , you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems \u2014 at your own campus or using the national-scale Open Science Pool \u2014 to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to get more information and help. The school is ideal for: Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing; Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum. People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Applications \u00b6 Applications are now closed for 2023. The deadline for applications was Monday, 18 April 2023. If still needed, have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to user-school@osg-htc.org (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best) For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally \u2014 ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the \u201cOSG User School 2023\u201d in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter. Applicants: We plan to review applications by late April and invite participants by early May or so. We will contact you once decisions have been made. Thank you for your patience!
